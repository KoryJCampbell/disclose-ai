    name: Veterans Benefits Eligibility Predictor
    version: 2.1.0
    type: classification
    architecture: Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost)
    description: Predicts likelihood of veteran eligibility for specific VA benefits programs based on service history,
      disability ratings, and demographic factors. Used as a decision-support tool to prioritize case reviews.
    framework: XGBoost / scikit-learn
    size: 45MB (ensemble of 500 trees)
    input_format: Structured tabular data (CSV/JSON)
    output_format: JSON with probability scores and feature importance
  intended_use:
    use_cases:
      - Prioritize veteran benefits applications for human review
      - Flag potentially eligible veterans who haven't applied
      - Reduce average processing time for benefits determination
    users:
      - VA Benefits Administration caseworkers
      - Regional Office supervisors

  limitations:
    known_limitations:
      - Performance gap for female and minority veterans
      - Limited to structured data; cannot process unstructured medical narratives
      - Requires minimum 60% of input fields to be populated
      - Does not account for policy changes after training data cutoff
    failure_modes:
      - Returns low confidence for veterans with unique service histories
      - May underperform for recently separated veterans with limited records
      - Edge cases with concurrent claims from multiple programs
